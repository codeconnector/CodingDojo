### I. Introduction
### First off... Welcome to the Coding Dojo!!! 
We are stoked to have you join the leadership! We will do anything we can to help you get up to speed so feel free to reach out to any one of us at any point. 
This doc is meant to serve as an onboarding guide/SOP of sorts, to new leaders of the coding dojo. This is a living document so feel free to check periodically for new updates or use as a reference.

### II. Initial Steps
First off go ahead and take a look at the repos Readme, next we suggest you take a look around the repo and get a feel for where everything is, check out past challenges, see the general format of the tests, challenge repo layout, etc. Your next should probably be the issues so you can get an eye on the upcoming challenges. Finally it's not a bad idea just to look at any past commits just to see the typical flow of things.

### III. Weekly Agenda

You probably already know but we meet at 12pm cst every Tuesday for Code Dojo. Typically as a leader you have a couple of things to take care of or keep an eye on each week. Typically the leadership team likes to scheudle out drivers, navigators, and challenges ahead of time for each meetup. With that said things may not always be planned out exactly but typically you can expect one of the following scenarios. Here we will start with the happy path. 

- Driver, Navigator, and Challenge are all scheudled: If this is the case you're role is likely Mob or Host, please see the [Dojo Readme](https://github.com/codeconnector/CodingDojo#readme) to refresh on those roles 

- No Driver, Navigator, or Challenge scheduled: If nobody has been scheulded, or noone volunteers to drive we the leaders will internally pick a driver and navigator among ourselves for the up coming Dojo. 

- Driver, Navigator scheulded: At this point all that needs to be decided on is which challenge will be used from the [issues](https://github.com/codeconnector/CodingDojo/issues).

### IV. Issues

The issues is where we store up upcoming challenges, as a leader is its partly your responsibility to help maintain a healthy amount of issues for upcoming challenges. Feel free to add new challenges as need or ask any of the other leaders about any challnges you are considering adding. Keep in mind that the challenges should be as scoped as they can to the hour length of the meetup.
