# Upcoming Host/Driver/Navigator for CodingDojo Meetups

Each week, we rotate the Host, Driver, and Navigator for the [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/memphis-technology-user-groups/events/lnbhhsyccgbkc/). This file will serve as a list/schedule/signup for upcoming meetup roles. If you're interested in serving as a Driver (it's actually a lot of fun), come join us in the [#code](https://join.slack.com/t/code-connector/shared_invite/zt-6e1idsg6-wYI1hdfk_hR_QKahSBwldQ) CodeConnector Slack channel.
