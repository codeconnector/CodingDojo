## IMPORTANT NOTE

If your input array has a length of less than 3, your solution should return an EMPTY ARRAY instead of null. We made this change because of the strict typing restrictions of the language.

### Tackling This Challenge in C#
1. Make sure you've got the required software on your machine: [.NET Core 3.0+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and a text editor.
2. If you haven't already, fork the CodingDojo repository ([INSTRUCTIONS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)).
3. Enter your solution code in the `BlastFromthePast.cs` file
4. Run the tests to check your solution by navigating to this directory and running `./run-tests` or `dotnet test`.
5. Submit your solution to the repo using [this solutions guide in our wiki](https://github.com/codeconnector/CodingDojo/wiki#solutions).
