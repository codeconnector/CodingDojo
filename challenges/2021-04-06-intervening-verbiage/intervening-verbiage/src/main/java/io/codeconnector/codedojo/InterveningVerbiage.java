/**
 * # Intervening Verbiage
 *
 * Given two words in a string of words, count the number of other words between
 * the two words you are given.
 *
 * ## Business Rules/Errata
 *
 * - Your solution will take in three pieces of input: a string containing a
 * space-separated list of words, and two other strings representing the first
 * and second words, respectively.
 * - You may ignore all punctuation and capitalization.
 * - If your two words are not in the string of words, alert the user to an error.
 * - You should return a count of the words between your two words as an integer,
 * not the words themselves.
 * - If your words appear multiple times in the list of words, count words that
 * fall between the first  instance of each.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * ```
 * list_of_words = "There was an old lady who lived in an outhouse";
 * count_words_between("lady", "outhouse", list_of_words)  // 4
 * count_words_between("an", "outhouse", list_of_words)    // 6
 * ```
 *
 * - The words 'who', 'lived', 'in', 'an' appear between 'lady' and 'outhouse'.
 * - The words 'old', 'lady', 'who', 'lived', 'in', 'an' appear between the
 * first instance of 'an' and 'outhouse'.
