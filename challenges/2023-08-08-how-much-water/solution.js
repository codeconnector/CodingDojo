// How Much Water?
//
// You are given a list of integers, where each value represents the height of
// a vertical bar that can be placed perpendicular to the x-axis and the index
// of each value represents it's position on the x-axis. Using this list, find
// the maximum amount of water that can be contained by any two bars together
// with the x-axis. For example, given the list `[1, 8, 2, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 
// ]`, the maximum amount of water that can be contained is `49`.

function maximumWater(barHeights) {
  // your solution goes here
  return
}

module.exports = { maximumWater };
