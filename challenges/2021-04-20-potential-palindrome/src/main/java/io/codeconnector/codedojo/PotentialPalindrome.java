/*
 * # Potential Palindrome
 * 
 * Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome. 
 * A palindrome is any string that can be read the same both forwards and 
 * backwards, such as "kayak".
 * 
 * ## Business Rules/Errata
 * 
 * - You only need to determine whether it is possible to make a palindrome, 
 * you do not need to return an example of the palindrome.
 * - Any input that is not a string should be treated as a string, if possible.
 * - An empty string is not a palindrome.
 * 
 * ## Examples
 * 
 * ```bash
 * canMakePalindrome("carrace");  // True
 * ```
 * 
 * The string `carrace` can be rearranged to make `racecar`, a palindrome.
