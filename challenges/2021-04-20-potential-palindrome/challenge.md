# Potential Palindrome

Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome. A palindrome is any string that can be read the same both forwards and backwards, such as "kayak".

## Business Rules/Errata

- You only need to determine whether it is possible to make a palindrome, you do not need to return an example of the palindrome.
- Any input that is not a string should be treated as a string, if possible.
- An empty string is not a palindrome.

## Examples

```bash
canMakePalindrome("carrace");  // True
```

The string `carrace` can be rearranged to make `racecar`, a palindrome.

## Tackling This Challenge

1. Make sure you've got the required software on your machine: A JDK 11+
1. If you haven't already, fork the CodingDojo repository ([INSTRUCTIONS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)).
1. Checkout a new branch using `git checkout -b yourgithubusername-wip`.
1. Add your code to the 'mob.java' file to make the `countWordsBetween` function work as expected.
1. Confirm your solution by running tests. Execute the `test-it.sh` script (use `./test-it.sh` from the challenge root directory.
1. If you've passed all the tests, the `test-it.sh` script provide instructions to help you commit it. Otherwise, try again to pass all tests.
1. Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/codeconnector/CodingDojo), and submit your pull request.
1. One of the CodingDojo maintainers will help you get your PR merged.

## Requirements

- JDK 11+
