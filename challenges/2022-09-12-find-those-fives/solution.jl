# # Find Those Fives

# Ah, children are truly a gift! Except, of course, when your extremely spoiled nephew 
# is having a fifth birthday party, his parents are pushovers, and this little monster 
# has a _very_ specific request for his "favorite" uncle/aunt. See, a love of numbers 
# runs in the family, and while this apple seems to have fallen from the tree, rolled 
# down the hill a bit, and bumped into multiple roots on the way down, he wants to 
# celebrate this momentous occasion by decorating his house with _every_ number 
# containing the digit `5`. Now, of course, even his doting parents can't provide 
# decorations containing _every_ number, they wouldn't be done in time to make the cake 
# or buy presents. On the other hand, they're somehow willing to decorate with an 
# _arbitrarily large_ set of numbers. In order to plan appropriately, they've requested 
# (begged) you to devise some algorithm for determining how many times the digit `5` 
# appears in a sequence of numbers.

# Being the loving uncle/aunt you are (and secretly being glad this isn't _your_ kid), 
# you agree to write a function that, given a starting and ending number, will return a 
# count of all the times the digit `5` appears.

# ## Business Rules/Errate

# - Your function should take two integers and return a single integer representing the 
#   number of times the digit `5` appears in the range.
# - The range you inspect should be inclusive on both ends, so for the range from 1-5, 
#   you should inspect the numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
# - Your given range will always have a smaller starting value than ending value.
# - You should be prepared for negative numbers. (Who taught this kid about negative 
#   numbers!?)
# - If a number in the sequence you inspect contains more than one `5`, count each 
#   digit.
