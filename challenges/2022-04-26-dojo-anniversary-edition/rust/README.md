# Tackling This Challenge

1. Make sure you've got the required software on your machine: Rust 2021 edition
2. If you haven't already, fork the CodingDojo repository ([INSTRUCTIONS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)) and check out a working branch.
3. Modify the `src/lib.rs` file in this folder to solve the puzzle(s)!
4. Run the tests to check your solution by navigating to this directory and running `cargo test`.
5. When you're ready, copy the `lib.rs` file to 'solutions/rust/<yourgithubusername>.rs'.
6. Commit _just your solutions file_  and submit your pull request. If you need some help with that, see [this solutions guide in our wiki](https://github.com/codeconnector/CodingDojo/wiki#solutions).
