// # Mirror Words
// ## Rules
// - Write a function that accepts as its argument a whitespace-separated 
//   string and returns that same string where each word has its letters 
//   reversed.
// - Since this is your first assignment, the words will always be separated 
//   by a single space and there will be no punctuation.
// - Letters in the output should also appear as the same case as they appeared 
//   in the input.
// - The reverse of an empty string is an empty string.
// - The reverse of a word with only one letter is just that letter.
// - You may also un-comment some additional test cases that add complexity to 
//   the function. These are not required to solve the puzzle.

// ## Example

// ```
// reverseWords("I know what you did last summer") -> "I wonk tahw uoy did tsal remmus"
// reverseWords("") -> ""
// reverseWords("a b c") -> "a b c"
// ```

function reverseWords(votes) {
  // your solution goes here
  return
}

module.exports = { reverseWords };
