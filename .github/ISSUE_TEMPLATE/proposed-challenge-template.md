# Title

Description of the coding challenge. Any backstory or setup should go here. The title should be somewhat informative and unique, so that individual challenges can be easily identified.

# Business Rules/Errata

- This section should be a bulleted list.
- This section should contain relevant business rules.
- This section should identify known constraints/edge cases (i.e., the input list will always be ordered, if the argument is empty then throw an exception, etc.)
- **If additional notes/requirements are determined (as a result of clarifying questions in comments), add those additional notes here in bold.**

# Examples

This section should provide examples of expected inputs/outputs like so:

```
sample_function(input);  // expected output
```

In cases where one of the arguments is large and cumbersome to type on one line, prefer this format:

```
input = "some very long string to operate on that takes up a lot of room";
sample_function(input, 'a')  // expected output
```
