# Resources

This directory is intended to hold resources used by multiple challenges, such as `*.jar` files used by Java-based challenges and testing scripts. Resources will be nested in sub-directories by the languages that rely on those resources. For example, the JUnit .jar file is in `resources/java/junit-<version>.jar`.
