# Contributing to the Code Connector Website

There are a few things to know before getting started contributing to this repository. Before getting into it, we'd like to thank you for your interest and let you know that we love contributions of any size and are here to support and welcome first time contributors!

## Code of Conduct

## How can one contribute?

### Submit Challenges

Challenges can be submitted as issues on this repository. We will attempt to use voting on these issues as a method of prioritizing challenges for their selection.

### Attend the Meetup

During the meetup we will practice mob/group programming where we encourage a newer/learning developer to take the wheel as we work together to create a solution to the challenge in whatever language is chose. 

### Submit Solutions

Just because the meetup is over doesn't mean you can't still participate in the Coding Dojo. Please try solving any of the puzzles you find here as you are able. You can submit your solutions to the repository through a PR and get some Git practice in to boot! Check out our [wiki](https://github.com/codeconnector/CodingDojo/wiki) for submission guidelines. Links to all past challenges can be found in the SCHEDULE.md file.
